Please only use first names, nicknames, or initials - DO NOT USE FULL NAMES. If two people have the same first name, then add a last initial. You can enter any identifier you'd like in place of a name - all that matters is that you know the person you mean, as the ""names"" you enter will be used later in the survey.
